-- A. Customer Journey
-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions 
-- table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run 
-- some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
